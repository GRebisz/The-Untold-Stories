# Gregory Rebisz — Technical Content Writer

**Software developer turned technical content writer.** I write about the things I've spent years building — enterprise SaaS, backend performance, developer tooling, and the messy reality of shipping production code.

I don't write about technology from the outside looking in. I write about it from the codebase looking out.

## What I Write

**Technical Blog Posts & Articles** — Long-form pieces that turn engineering problems into readable stories. Performance deep-dives, architecture decisions, lessons learned from production incidents.

**Developer Documentation** — READMEs, API guides, onboarding docs, and knowledge base articles that developers actually want to read. Written by someone who's been the frustrated developer staring at bad docs.

**Product & Tool Descriptions** — Copy for developer tools, SaaS platforms, and B2B tech products. I understand the product because I've built products like it.

**Technical Tutorials & How-To Guides** — Step-by-step walkthroughs grounded in real implementation experience, not theoretical fluff.
